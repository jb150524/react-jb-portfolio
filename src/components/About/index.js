        I'm a Graphic Designer trying to become a full stack developer. I am from Guadalajara, Mexico. One of my favorite hobbies is playing competative soccer. Playing soccer has taught me perseverance, how to be a team player, and most importantly how to lose. I currently live in Wayne, Pennsylvania, but have previously lived in Guadalajara, Mexico and Orange County, California. I want to become a web developer because I want to learn a skill that motivates me and pushes me to try new things. I am excited about web developing and want a career that gives me a spark, like I get when I play soccer, with competitiveness, passion, and the belief that I can succeed.
